# movie-sql-database

I wanted to create a database that tracks movies, their genres, and their ratings. The goal of the database is to recommend movies based on the ratings provided by members, which are in the form of letter grades. There are 4 tables: members, movie, genres, and rate. Maketables.sql has all table information, Populatetables.sql has all the data for the tables, and searchrecords.sql is where the queries were made.
